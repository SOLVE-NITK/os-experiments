<h3>Introduction</h3>
Banker's Algorithm is mainly used for deadlock avoidance while allocation maximum amount of
resources to safe state. There are four main factors:
<dl>
    <dt>Allocation</dt>
    <dd>Alloction is the array representing how many instances of each resource is allocated or already taken
        by the process.</dd>
    <dt>Maximum</dt>
    <dd>Maximum is the array representing how many instances of each resource is required for the process to
        execute.</dd>
    <dt>Need</dt>
    <dd>Need is the array representing how many instances of each resoruce is required after the processes has
        taken up some instances as per allocated array.</dd>
    <dt>Available</dt>
    <dd>Available is the array representing how many instances of each resource is available which process can
        request and get permission to use.</dd>
</dl>
Initially when a new process enters a system, it will declare the maximum instances of each resource that is required
for its execution. The process gets some of the available instances of each processes. The algorithm is applied on a
set of these kind of processes.
