<h3>Theory</h3>
The algoritm is as follows:<br /><br />
We have the maximum, allocated given for each process in the set of processes.Now we need available. If the value is
given then we can directly use it else we need to calculate it. To calculate the value we need to have the maximum
instances of each resource that the system has. Then we need to subtract the maximum number of instances of a resource
by the sum of all the instanaces of the resource in allocated of processes.<br /><br />
Then we start with calculation of need. We calculate need for eac of the resource as :<br />Need = Maximum - Available<br />
When we have completed the calculation of the need for each resource for each and every process, we start with the
finding the safe sequence for execution of the process.<br /><br />
To check whether a process can be executed selected from the set of unexecuted processes in the system we apply the
following set
of equations.
<ol>
    <li>Work = Available</li>
    <li>Need &lt;= Work</li>
    <li>Work = Work + Allocation</li>
</ol>
<br />
We continue this with the processes in the set of processes as long as either of the two situations arises.
<dl>
    <dt>Case 1</dt>
    <dd>All the processes have completed their execution.</dd>
    <dt>Case 2</dt>
    <dd>Need &gt; Available ; for all processes in the set of remaining processes</dd>
</dl>
<br />
If the case is Case 1, then we get the safe sequence of execution but if the case is Case 2, then the system is not in
safe state.
