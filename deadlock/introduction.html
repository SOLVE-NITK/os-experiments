<h3>Introduction</h3>
DeadLock is a situation where a process are waiting for getting access resource which is already allocated to some
other resource and that resource is waiting for resource whose access is held by this process. At this situation both
the processes will prevent each other from getting access to the resource they want hence resulting in a deadlock where
none of the process can complete execution.<br />
Consider P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> are two processes.<br />
P<sub>1</sub> requests for resource X and acquires it, P<sub>2</sub> request for resource Y and acquires it.<br />
For further execution P<sub>1</sub> need resource Y for execution and P<sub>2</sub> need resource X for execution.<br />
At such a situation, both the processes will wait until resource is set free. They will be remaining in wait state for
ever and hence leading to a deadlock.<br />
To proceed operating system won't understand what action to take.<br />
Only way is to abort or stop one process which will release the resource, complete the second process releasing all the
resources so that the first process can complete its execution.
