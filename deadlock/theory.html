<h3>Theory</h3>
Dinner Philosopher problem is an example that is normally considerd when considering about deadlock. The problem is
about 5 philosophers. The 5 philosophers are seated around a circular table. Each of the philosopher is given with one
chopstick. The mandatory condition is that philosophers can eat only if they has 2 chopstick. There are 3 states:
<ol>
    <li>Thinking</li>
    <li>Hungry</li>
    <li>Eating</li>
</ol><br />
Inicially all philosophers are thinking. When a philosopher is hungry then he will pick the chopsticks from his left
and right of which one is his chopstick and other from neighbouring philosopher and starts eating. Now the philosopher
whose chopstick was taken has to wait till he receives back his chopstick and also get chopstick from the other side
before he starts eating. If all philosopher wants to eat at same time then all of them will have their chopstick and
they will be waiting for the second chopstick. They will remain in that stae for ever. This is the deadlock beacuse no
one can complete the task of having food and will be forever waiting to get second chopstick. Inorder to solve this
problem semaphores (variable which is used to solve critical section problem) or monitors can be used.
<h4>Solution to DeadLock in Dinner Philosopher problem</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Philosopher must pick chopstick only if both left and right chopstick are available.</li>
    <li>Only make four Philosophers to sit in circular table such that there will be one chopstick left on table. In
        this way deadlock can be avoided.</li>
</ol>
