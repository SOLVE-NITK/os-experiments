<h3>Introduction</h3>
System call fork() is a system call used by a parent process to create a child process. When a process is executing, it
may need some other process to execute either along with it or to complete executing befor it can proceed. The process
that is executing is the parent process and the process it creates is a child process. The naming is done so for the
processes based on the creation ie. the process that created the new process is the parent process and the process that
was created is called the child process. In short, fork creates a child process of which the calling function is a
parent. The fork function is a special function as it returns not one but two values. Fork returns one value to the
parent process and one value to the child process repectively. The parent gets the Process ID of the child from fork.
The child gets value zero from fork.
