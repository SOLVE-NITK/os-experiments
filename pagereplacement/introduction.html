<h3>Introduction</h3>
All systems have smaller main memory than secondary memory. So all
the content of the secondary memory cannot be loaded into the main
memory from the secondary memory. So, the contents of the secondary
memory is divided into pages. These pages are copied from the
secondary memory based on the requirement of the pages.<br />Consider
an example where we have 10 pages in the secondary memory and the
main memory can store only 2 pages. Initially main memory is empty,
then on request pages 3 and 5 are loaded. Now when page 6 is
required in the man memory, we need to replace it in the place of
either the page 3 or page 5 which are currently present in the main
memory. The main memory is full so replacement becomes necessary. So
to decide on which page to be chosen to be replaced, we use the page
replacement algorithm.
