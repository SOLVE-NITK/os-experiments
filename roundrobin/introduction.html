<h3>Introduction</h3>
Round Robin is method of scheduling the execution of a set of processes. The different process take turns and
execute. The execution time in each turn is known as quantum time. Normally, processes are arranged in a
circular queue and then given turn one after another. At each turn given to a process, the process tries to
complete the task it is intended to perform. If the remaining time is less than quantum time it completes
execution and leaves the queue. Else it completes as much as it can in the quantum time and then waits for
its next turn. When the process completes execution or reaches quantum time, the next process starts
execution. This process continues until there are no proceses are remaining in the list.
